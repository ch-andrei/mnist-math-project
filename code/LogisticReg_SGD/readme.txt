lr.py runs the stochastic gradient descent regressor. the SGD is very sensitive to learning rate changes. 

test.py will print the number of correctly predicted outputs to terminal.

before running lr.py, you should have a results.csv in the A3 folder. before you run test.py, you should move the results.csv into the data folder.
