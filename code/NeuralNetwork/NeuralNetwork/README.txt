To execute the code, please follow these steps:
- Open a terminal window
- Navigagte to the folder which contains this file
- Execute the following command
   - python MainNeuralNetwork.py

The following operations will be performed:
- Load data from processed_train_x.csv and train_y.csv (which are in the same directory as this file)
- Instantiate an instance of the NeuralNetwork class found in NeuralNetwork.py.
  This is the file and class which contains our implementation of a 
  Fully connected feedforward neural network.
- Train the neural network instance on the training data. 
- Print the accuracies throughout training iterations.

More detailed information can be found in the files MainNeuralNetwork.py and 
NeuralNetwork.py themselves in the form of comments.
